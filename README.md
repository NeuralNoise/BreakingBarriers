# LingoChat

LingoChat is a full-stack web application that lets people send and receive text messages with their friends and family in any language. By letting everyone use their own language, LingoChat allows for multilingual conversations. Users can create new contacts or import them from their gmail contacts. A user can preview and edit a translated message prior to sending it to their chosen contacts. If both users have an account in LingoChat, they can chat with each other live in their own languages via websockets. There is also sentiment analysis where each user's messages are broken down into positive, negative and neutral categories. Each user can also see which contacts got the most positive, negative or neutral messages.
